# Fallout:Frost
The year is 2122, Vault 420 -- located somewhere in what used to be Cananda -- appears to be one of the very few remaining active shelters in North America, as the world is clearly still suffering the damages of the Wars from â€˜24. The Vault that you're currently residing is facing tremendous supply shortages. In order to stop the crisis from affecting the future of their dwellers, the Overseers conducts an undercover experiment in order to find the best suitable person to wander where no dweller has, in order to help solve this issue in a timely manner.
